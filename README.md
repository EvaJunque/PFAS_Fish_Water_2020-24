Work on PFAS paper

Using R 4.4.3 from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.3
Rstudio version shouldn't matter too much. 64 bit.

Open rstudio, top menu "Tools", "Global Options", then under "General", change R version to the one just installed. Want to be a 64 bit version here too.

Then we open our project, in this case it is called it PFAS. So, Rstudio, Fiel, Open project, This PC, Documents, PFAS folder, PFAS (file is RProject).

Then, before we do anything, we PULL to get the updates. 

Once we change something, we make a COMMIT, or loads of commits, where you can write a note of changes made, and then you PUSH them.
